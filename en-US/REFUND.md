# Overview
This policy states our refund policy for this platform.

# Summary
In summary, most of our services are rely on our merchants decision, meaning that we cannot issue a refund if our merchants did not agree with the decision, unless it's violating our Terms.

For event services, please visit [Refund Policy: Events](/en-US/EVENTS/REFUND.md).

# Donation
In general, donations are considered to be final and non-refundable.

# Chargeback
It is important to read refund policy (from both sides, between the event organizer and platform policy) before you commit to purchase.

Before issuing chargebacks, it is crucial to communicate with the platform (and third-parties, if available) so both parties can issue you a proper refund.

We will ask the consumer's to revoke or appeal their chargeback claim while working together to find a better resolution (with third-parties, if involved)

If you think the chargeback was fraudulent or unfair, you can dispute it by getting a contact to **Anthro.id** team through our [contact page](/contact) and providing:
- Proof of purchase (email confirmation, invoices from your payment or wallet app)
- Identification card or any form that can identify you ("KTP" or national card ID, "SIM" or driver's license, passport, etc.)

If the consumer's refuses to cooperate, we will work with the consumer's bank to prove their purchase was valid and subsequently terminate their account for breaking our Terms of Service and block the credit card information from future purchases.

# Refund Coverage Details
