# Overview
This policy covers how our Platform handles accounts for underage individuals.

# Notice
Please note that our platform is not targeted at children under the age of 13, and they are not permitted to use the Platform.

We strongly encourage all parents and guardians to monitor their children's Internet use.

# Processing the Data
In rare cases where we collect personal information from children, we always seek parental or guardian consent and only collect such information for the specific purposes disclosed at the time of collection.

# Parental Controls
We cannot prohibit underage individuals from visiting our Platform and must rely on parents and/or guardians to decide what materials are appropriate for children to view.

You can find more information about parental guidance at [ftc.gov](https://consumer.ftc.gov/identity-theft-and-online-security/online-privacy-and-security) and [indonesiabaik.id](https://indonesiabaik.id/infografis/menjaga-anak-di-internet).
