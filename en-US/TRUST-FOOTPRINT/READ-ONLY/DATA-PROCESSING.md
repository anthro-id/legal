# Locations of Data Processing
Most consumers data is stored and processed through the nearest APAC (Asia-Pacific) server region, primarily in Jakarta, and then Singapore as a fallback.

Contents that meant for public, such as your profile picture or article banner, is distributed globally to reduce latency and bandwidth costs, thanks to [Bunny CDN](https://bunny.net/?ref=59m0uotfa1).

# Data Retention
Some data will be retained until a specified numbers of minutes, hours, or even years, while some will be kept for as long as the account remains active.

This helps us trace unwanted activities and ensures we comply with local laws and regulations.

This includes, not limited to:
- **Account activities**
  - We kept the activity logs of an account for up to **90 days**.
  - This includes what action did you took, what time did you perform the action, your anonymized two-octets IP address, and more.
  - For more information about this data, you can visit [**User Profile > Audit Log > Account Log**](https://anthro.id/user/profile/audit-log/account) on your profile.

- **Transaction records**
  - For legal compliance reason, we store our consumers' transaction records for at least **5 years**, in accordance with [Permenkominfo No. 20/2016 concerning Personal Data Protection in Electronic Systems, Article 15 paragraph (3)](https://peraturan.bpk.go.id/Details/150543/permenkominfo-no-20-tahun-2016).
  - For unsuccessful transaction such as abandoned payment or pending for settlement, those records will be deleted in 7 days if no changes available.
