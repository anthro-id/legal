# Use of Payments for Indonesia Residence
PayPal is not allowed for Indonesia resident as it may violate [Article 21 and 33 of Law Number 7 of 2011 on Currency (Pasal 21 dan 33 terkait Undang-Undang Nomor 7 tahun 2011 tentang Mata Uang)](https://peraturan.bpk.go.id/Details/39182).

**We highly recommend** that you continue using domestic-preferred payment vendor.

# Fees
We are committed to being fully transparent about these costs.

To ensure the platform remains operational, each transaction includes fees.

We have platform and payment fees. You can see more information about these fees down sections below.

Also, regarding the payment of fees, we offer two options: you may either pass the fees on to your consumers or choose to cover them yourself. The decision is entirely up to you.

## Platform Fees
We have a fixed percentage of fee for our services, applies to every transactions, which is:
- Local payments occurs **4%** of a platform fee.
- International/cross-border payments occurs **6%** of a platform fee.

Our platform fees are automatically deducted at the time of payment processing. This means the amount shown in your balance is already your net payout amount—no additional platform fees will be deducted during withdrawal. You will only need to factor in payment gateway fees for your final calculation.

## Out of Scopes
We do not charge fees other than those mentioned above for services such as refunds, withdrawals, etc.

For merchants, your final amount may be reduced by fees charged by our payment vendors.

## Conditions
We given our verified users full control over how they choose to handle these fees. And, some of users can choose to pass these fees to their customers.

# Foreign Exchange Rate
To ensure fairness, we use [Wise (formerly TransferWise)](https://wise.com) as our foreign exchange rate provider. The rates are updated every hour.

**Anthro.id** is not affiliated, endorsed, or sponsored by Wise.

# Internationalized Price (formerly Dollarized Price)
We given our users full control over how they going to price the item for users/residents outside Indonesia.

It is also depend on their own decision whether to use internationalized price (fixed price, defined by users) or converted price (let the system convert the original price from IDR to USD using the latest **Foreign Exchange Rate**).

If the user decides to use internationalized pricing, then only the fees (that are passed on to attendees/customers) will be converted.

# Rounding Decision
Any item pricing amount (including fees) will be rounded to the nearest 0.05 or 1/20th for convenience.
- For example:
  - The item is **$7.47**, our system will round the price to **$7.50**.
  - The fee is **$0.52**, our system will round the price to **$0.55**.

There is no rounding needed if the price of an item is fixed or no fraction unit. Such as, **$5.00** will always be **$5.00**.

This rounding system only applies to users who pay using our selected international payment vendors.
