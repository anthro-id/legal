# Summary
It is important that you read the policy that we provided, but here's a summary to get you started:

- **It is all up to you.** We require an email and password to create your account, but providing additional personal information, such as your legal name, is optional unless you choose to use specific services on our Platform. We only collect information that is necessary to operate and improve our services.

# What Information We Have & Where We Get It?
If you decide to use our services, we may also collect additional information necessary to facilitate your experience, such as event participation details, ticket purchases, and communication preferences.

- **When you create an account**, buy a ticket, become an event organizer, or have a ticket transferred to you by a friend, we may ask you to provide contact information such as your full name, email address, phone number, date of birth.
Providing this information is not mandatory until you engage in certain activities on our platform, such as purchasing a ticket or registering as an event organizer.
  - Additionally, we may request business-related information if you are an event organizer, such as your bank account details for ticket sale withdrawals, a valid government-issued ID for verification purposes. This information helps us ensure the security of transactions and prevent fraudulent activities.

- **When you create an account through a third-party platform**, we only receive the information that they provide based on their policies and your consent. We comply with their privacy policies and do not collect additional data beyond what is shared with us.

We may use tracking tools such as [Cloudflare Analytics](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/) to passively collect data about you, including your browser type, device information, and geographic location. This helps us analyze user behavior, optimize platform performance, and enhance security measures.

  - On the **Anthro.id / Events** platform, if a minor purchases a ticket, a parent or guardian must print, sign, and submit a physical copy of the **Underage Attendance Authorization** form—provided by us, or the event organizer—to the event organizer when the event begins. A copy may also be submitted to **Anthro.id**, but only if the event organizer has granted us permission to store it.
