# Overview
When you access to our publications or this website, we and third parties may process Personal Information about you.

In this section, we provide an overview of our privacy practices.

# Summary
It is important that you read the policy that we provided, but here's a summary to get you started:

- **It is all up to you.** We require an email and password to create your account, but providing additional personal information, such as your legal name, is optional unless you choose to use specific services on our Platform. We only collect information that is necessary to operate and improve our services.

- **We give you control.**

- **We don't sell your personal information.** Our business is based on features and/or services that we provided to our users, not from selling your personal information to other parties.

- **For us, and others safety.** We use certain information to help identify violations of our [Terms of Use](/legal/terms) and to prevent unlawful activities from occurring on the Platform.

# What Information We Have & Where We Get It?
If you decide to use our services, we may also collect additional information necessary to facilitate your experience, such as event participation details, ticket purchases, and communication preferences.

- **When you create an account**, buy a ticket, become an event organizer, or have a ticket transferred to you by a friend, we may ask you to provide contact information such as your full name, email address, phone number, date of birth.
Providing this information is not mandatory until you engage in certain activities on our platform, such as purchasing a ticket or registering as an event organizer.
  - Additionally, we may request business-related information if you are an event organizer, such as your bank account details for ticket sale withdrawals, a valid government-issued ID for verification purposes. This information helps us ensure the security of transactions and prevent fraudulent activities.

- **When you create an account through a third-party platform**, we only receive the information that they provide based on their policies and your consent. We comply with their privacy policies and do not collect additional data beyond what is shared with us.

- **When you're using our platform(s)**, we'll collect your IP address and browser identity to protect against fraud, ensure platform security, and improve our services. This information helps us detect suspicious activities, prevent unauthorized access, and enhance user experience.
We may use tracking tools such as [Cloudflare Analytics](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/) to passively collect data about you, including your browser type, device information, and geographic location. This helps us analyze user behavior, optimize platform performance, and enhance security measures.
  - Some features, services, or products on our Platform may require us to collect sensitive information for verification and security purposes. This may include, but not limited to:
    - information on identity card and photo,
    - biometric data.

- **When you contact Anthro.id to provide feedback or resolve an issue**, we record that interaction for evidentiary purposes and to provide support related to your query.

- **Processing of Underage Individuals' Data**. In rare cases where we collect personal information from children, we always seek parental or guardian consent and only collect such information for the specific purposes disclosed at the time of collection.
  - On the **Anthro.id / Events** platform, if a minor purchases a ticket, a parent or guardian must print, sign, and submit a physical copy of the **Underage Attendance Authorization** form—provided by us, or the event organizer—to the event organizer when the event begins. A copy may also be submitted to **Anthro.id**, but only if the event organizer has granted us permission to store it.

# How We Protect Your Data, Who We Share It With, and Why?
We use military-grade encryption to keep your data private and secure while in transit.

We store your information using certified vendors such as [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com) and [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), which offer robust security measures and data encryption to further protect your data. Each vendor's privacy policy and terms of service also apply.

For example, when you purchase a ticket, we may or may not forward your data, including your legal name and/or phone number, to our trusted payment processing vendors such as [Midtrans (Indonesia)](https://midtrans.com) and [Paddle (International)](https://paddle.com) to enable them to process your payment. Please see [Midtrans Policy](https://midtrans.com/privacy-notice) and [Paddle Policy](https://www.paddle.com/legal/privacy) for more information how they process personal information related to payments.

For legal disclosures, we may share information to comply with a court order or subpoena. Additionally, we may provide information to government agencies as required by law. We may also share information when investigating potential crimes, including fraud.


# Data Retention
We retain personal information for as long as it is needed. It means that we retain your personal data for as long as you have an active **Anthro.id** account.

Some information you can delete directly from our Platform.

Some of our services, features, or products may require additional verification that involves collecting sensitive information, such as a government-issued ID. For each type of information, we determine the data retention period based on the reasons outlined below:
- **Attendees verification**:
  - Event organizers may choose to enable this feature to prevent ticket touting and similar types of fraud.
  - If you submit a government-issued ID for purchasing a ticket, your data will be verified in real-time and deleted immediately after the purchase is completed.
- **Bank information details**:
  - If you are an event organizer, your bank details will be retained as long as you use our services that require them for fund withdrawals.
